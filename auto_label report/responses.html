outcomes., The primary outcome was the change of lesions on VIA at 2 months after application of the investigational drug., Secondary outcomes were: HPV clearance and cytologic regression at 2 months and 6 months, and number of participants with AEs., A total 327 VIA positive women were randomized in two groups (168 in AV2 group and 159 in placebo group)., Women in the 2 groups were similar with respect to baseline demographics and clinical characteristics., At 2 months, regression of lesions on VIA was observed in 127 (89.4%) out of 142 women in AV2 group compared to 120 (91.6%) out of 131 women in placebo group (P = 0.7)., On cytology, regression of lesions occurred in 14 (56%) out of 25 women in the AV2 arm and in 13 (48.1) out of 27 women in the placebo arm (p = 0.7), and HPV clearance rates were 34.1% and 35% in AV2 group and placebo group respectively (p = 0.8)., At 6 months cytologic regression was observed in 64.7% of women in AV2 group and 45.8% in placebo group (p = 0.2), while HPV clearance occurred in 11 (51.9%) out of 17 women in AV2 arm versus 11 (34.4%) in placebo arm (p = 0.3).Some local side effects (burning, itching, irritation) were similarly noted in the 2 groups (p-values = 0.169, 0.623 and 0.172 respectively) but they were mild and transitory., A topical application of AV2 onto the cervix can induce the regression of cervical precancerous lesions, but its efficacy does not significantly differ with that of placebo., The discrepancy between the expected and the recorded sample size as well as the huge number of lost to follow-up probably impeded the power of analyses, which could be one of the reasons for the lack of difference seen between AV2 and placebo., Further evaluation of the effects of AV2 with different diagnostic methods and treatment regimen and arms is warranted., NCT02346227 registered on November 8, 2014.]</td>

28, 2015, to Nov 12, 2015, 1187 potential participants were screened, 665 entered run-in, and 504 received BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg (n=201), BUP-XR 300 mg/100 mg (n=203), or placebo (n=100)., Mean participants' percentage abstinence was 41·3% (SD 39·7) for BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg and 42·7% (38·5) for 300 mg/100 mg, compared with 5·0% (17·0) for placebo (p&lt;0·0001 for both BUP-XR regimens)., No compensatory non-opioid drug use was observed during BUP-XR treatment., The most common adverse events were headache (17 [8%] participants in the BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg group vs 19 [9%] participants in the BUP-XR 300 mg/100 mg group vs six [6%] participants in the placebo group), constipation (16 [8%] vs 19 [9%] vs 0), nausea (16 [8%] vs 18 [9%] vs five [5%]), and injection-site pruritis (19 [9%] vs 13 [6%] vs four [4%])., The BUP-XR safety profile was consistent with other buprenorphine products for treatment of opioid use disorder, except for injection-site reactions, which were reported in more than 5% of all participants who received BUP-XR, but were mostly mild and not treatment-limiting., Participants' percentage abstinence was significantly higher in both BUP-XR groups than in the placebo group., Treatment with BUP-XR was also well tolerated., The availability of this monthly formulation, delivered by health-care providers, represents an advance in treatment for opioid use disorder that enhances the benefits of buprenorphine by delivering sustained, optimal exposure, while reducing risks of current buprenorphine products., Indivior.]</td>

      <td>[Eighty-nine patients with knee osteoarthritis participated in this study., One group received ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electrical stimulation, exercise, and cold packs., The second group received ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electrical stimulation, exercise, and intermittent pneumatic compression., Range of motion, muscle strength, knee swelling, pain intensity, and functional status were measured at baseline and 4th week., We found significant improvements in range of motion, muscle strength, pain intensity, and functional status after the treatment in both groups (  &lt; 0.05)., When comparing the effects of these two treatment programs, it was observed that the intermittent pneumatic compression treatment group had a better outcome in terms of knee swelling ( =0.028)., According to the results, we could report that intermittent pneumatic compression therapy in addition to conventional treatment has significant positive effects on clinical outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis., We could also report that intermittent pneumatic compression therapy along with conventional treatment is superior to cold-pack therapy along with conventional treatment in terms of knee swelling in patients with knee osteoarthritis., This trial is registered with NCT03806322.]</td>

      <td>[Despite advances in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is currently no prospect of a cure, and evidence shows that multifactorial interventions can benefit patients., A promising therapeutic alternative is the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) simultaneously with cognitive intervention., The combination of these non-pharmacological techniques is apparently a safe and accessible approach., This study protocol aims to compare the efficacy of tDCS and cognitive intervention in a double-blind, randomized and factorial clinical trial., The treatment will last 8 weeks, with a 12-month follow-up., The primary outcome will be the improvement of global cognitive functions, evaluated by the AD Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog)., The secondary outcomes will include measures of functional, affective, and behavioral components, as well as a neurophysiological marker (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF)., This study will enable us to assess, both in the short and long term, whether tDCS is more effective than the placebo and to examine the effects of combined therapy (tDCS and cognitive intervention) and isolated treatments (tDCS vs. cognitive intervention) on patients with AD., : www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02772185-May 5, 2016.]</td>
